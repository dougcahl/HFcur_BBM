%% process Doppler spectra
HFcur_BBM_sub;

%% processing currents to a filled in current map 
% I was using this code for single locations and the full current maps are
% a work in progress currently.

% after this you want to interpolate onto all the radar current
% measurement locations. 

% For beamforming, there is a results at almost all
% locations but maybe a minimum SNR will be helpful to reduce outliers
% and/or some weighted interpolation function over space to remove outliers

% For Beamscan and MUSIC, either a signal (for MUSIC) or SNR (for beamscan)
% weighted interpolation function over space or a signal/SNR threshold to
% remove outliers will be necessary. Beamscan and MUSIC produce far fewer
% DOAs than beamforming so interpolation in space (common) and/or time
% (uncommon) is required for a full current map. 

% There are several other methods for outlier removal in the literature
